1.4 "Token"
The term “Token” shall refer to the physical poker chip or other associated object that confers the right to request one (1) favor from the Issuer under the terms and conditions described herein.

1.5 "Favour" or "Favor"
The term “Favour” or “Favor” shall refer to a singular act, service, or concession that the Issuer has agreed to consider performing, so long as it is in compliance with these Terms and Conditions and is not otherwise prohibited herein or by law.


SECTION 2: ACCEPTANCE AND REDEMPTION OF TOKEN

2.1 Right of Redemption
2.1.1 Authorized Redeemer
Only the Recipient is authorized to redeem the Token for a Favour. Any attempted redemption by a Third Party without the express written approval of the Issuer shall be deemed invalid.
2.1.2 Mandatory Written Approval for Transfer
If the Token is sold, gifted, or otherwise transferred to a Third Party, the Favour can only be redeemed if the Third Party obtains prior written approval from the Issuer (Greg McKenzie). Failure to obtain such written approval shall nullify any claim to a Favour.

2.2 Token Limitations
2.2.1 Single-Use Nature
Each Token is valid for a single Favour only. Once redeemed, the Token is considered spent and is invalid for any additional requests.
2.2.2 Expiration
The Token and its associated Favour shall expire one (1) year after the date the Recipient originally received the Token. After the expiration date, the Token shall be deemed void and any attempt at redemption shall be invalid.


SECTION 3: TOKEN TRANSFER AND MONETARY RESTRICTIONS

3.1 Minimum Sale Price
3.1.1 10 CAD Minimum
The Token may only be sold or transferred to a Third Party for a sum not less than ten (10) Canadian dollars, adjusted for inflation as of the date the Recipient received the Token. Any attempted sale below this amount shall render the transfer void unless the Issuer provides written approval to the contrary.
3.1.2 Gifts vs. Sales
Gifting of the Token without monetary exchange is permitted; however, the acceptance of this gifted Token still requires compliance with all Terms and Conditions, including the requirement for Issuer approval for redemption by the Third Party.


SECTION 4: SCOPE OF FAVOUR

4.1.1 Reasonable Requests
All requests for Favours shall be reasonable in nature. The Issuer retains sole and final discretion to determine whether a Favour request is “reasonable.”

Favours that are blatantly illegal, morally reprehensible, or physically impossible (such as “climb Mount Everest in my honor next Tuesday”) shall be automatically disallowed, at the sole discretion of the Issuer.

4.2 Sexual Favour Clause
4.2.1 Conditional Consideration
Sexual Favours may be considered if they fall within the acceptable tastes, preferences, and willingness of the Issuer at the time of redemption.
4.2.2 Attractiveness, Relationship Status, and Tiredness
Approval for sexual Favours is contingent upon the Recipient’s perceived attractiveness (according to the subjective tastes of the Issuer), the Issuer’s relationship status, and the Issuer’s level of tiredness or desire at the time of redemption. The Issuer reserves the right to decline any sexual Favour request for any reason whatsoever without explanation.
